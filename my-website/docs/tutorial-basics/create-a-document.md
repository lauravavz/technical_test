# Creating a project group

The goal of creating a project group is to be able to share it with colleagues and collaborate on it.

To do this, in the menu bar, click on **“Groups”** then **“New group”**.

## Create your first Doc

Create a markdown file at `docs/hello.md`:

```md title="docs/hello.md"
# Hello

This is my **first Docusaurus document**!
```
