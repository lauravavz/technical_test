# Importing a CSV file

If you have a large list of specific words to add to your dictionary, rather than adding them one by one, you have the option of uploading a CSV file.

To do this, go to the menu on the left on the "Import" tab, then check the fields you want to detail. We advise you to always fill in the tag and category of all words. If you want to register a compound word, an expression, a proper number or an abbreviation, you must enter the lemma (identical to the compound word, the expression or the proper number and abbreviation).
