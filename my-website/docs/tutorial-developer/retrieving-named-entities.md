**NER** ("Named Entity Recognition") is a common problem in NLP which consists in extracting entities from a text and classifying them in predefined categories (date, organization, speed, mass ... ).

Lettria allows you to extract and manipulate no less than 40 different entities. See the exhaustive list of entities managed by the Lettria API.
